# 🟢 IsPalindrome

**Recommended Time:** 5 - 10 min

**Topics:** Strings, Loops, Arrays, Boolean Logic

## Task
Write a function named `isPalindrome` that determines whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

Treat the input exactly as given (case-sensitive). For example, `"Racecar"` is *not* a palindrome unless the case matches exactly.

`isPalindrome` is expected to take in one string as its argument

## Input/Output
- Input: [You need to figure this out]
- Output: `true` if the word passed in is a palindrome, `false` otherwise.

## Examples

```text
Input: "radar"
Output: true
Explanation: radar spelled backwards is radar

Input: "hello"
Output: false

Input: ""
Output: true

Input: "a"
Output: true

Input: "Racecar"
Output: false
Explanation: Case sensitivity

Input: "racecar"
Output: true
```
