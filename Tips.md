# 💡 Success Guide & Additional Tips

## 📋 Quick Note
> A small note about Daylen: I took this course in 2025 like all of you. I made this to give you personal insights to me being in your shoes, and my friends alongside me who have complained to me about the course.

This study guide is designed to teach you how to **"think like a coder"**, not just test your knowledge of the course up to this point.  

We made this knowing a lot of you have the question: I know the syntax, when I see the solutions it makes sense, but **how do I come up with a solution?**


## 🧠 Strategic Problem Solving

### 1. Plan Before You Code
If you can't immediately see an obvious solution (which is expected for the medium & especially the hard problems), **do not just start writing code**.
* Draw Flowcharts: Visualize the logic.
* Write Comments: Type out your steps in plain English first.
* Use Paper/Tablet: Scribble down your ideas.
* Why? Problem-solving and innovation are the hard parts; the actual coding is often straightforward once you have a plan.

### 2. Read Carefully
It sounds simple—you were told this as a kid—but a lot of errors come from not fully understanding the question.
* **Read the question.**
* If you don't understand it, read it again
* While you are working on the problem, read it again

### 3. Don't cheat
This is obviously not graded. You voluntarily came here to prepare better for the exam. Why are you using AI or looking at our solutions so quick? Think & struggle please! You will not have these tools during the final. Whether you cheat on these problems is up to you, but we make these problems to be a resource for you and by cheating you are wasting it.

If you want my recommendation, **once you are over the recommended time, you can't come up with anything, or you got the right answer, only then use external tools and look at the solution.**

### 4. Move on

Sometimes you cannot get a problem because you are not in the right space at that time. Do not get stuck on one problem. Move onto another, then maybe coming back might allow you to approach it differently.

## 📃 What this means for the final
* If you can complete the problems in the recommended times or less, you will do well.
* **You should be capable of solving all problems, including the hard difficulty.**
* We made the recommended times and difficulties as students like yourself who have taken the final before. This is so you know what to expect for the final.

## 🛏️ Health

- **Don't overwork:** I would never ever ever ever recommend doing every problem in this guide in one sitting. Think about doing it every day building up to the final, doing an hour in the morning, hour in the afternoon, and hour at night. Consistency puts it in long term memory and it becomes more natural. Cramming puts it in short term memory and you become overly stressed. 
- **Sleep early:** Don't be working at 6am like us making this guide. You will always think better with good sleep. 
- **Eat right:** Fuel your brain with the right thing, it won't operate at your highest level otherwise. 
- **Don't overthink it:** You are taking this exam either way, so just do your best in prepping. 

## 🗣 Last Encouraging Words

- Although you and someone else might have gotten the same grade, they might've not studied at all whereas you dedicated countless, sleepless nights. Always compare yourself to only yourself, be better than who you were yesterday. 
- You are more than just a grade in the gradebook, you are human. On the surface, the TAs and Instructors can only see this. But know, that we do care about what you feel underneath and that you are sentient beings who have your own achievements and struggles. 
- You will do fine on this final. As TAs who has seen you guys struggle and still get back up, We recognize your efforts, we would never sell you guys short by giving you crappy problems. We want to see you succeed and enjoy programming, that's why we dedicated a lot of time to make this.
- Always feel free to reach out to either of us, we are with you.
