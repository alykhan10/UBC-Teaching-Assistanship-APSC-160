# 💡 Success Guide & Additional Tips

## A Note from the TA
> "A small note about me: I took this course in 2025 like all of you. I made this to give you personal insights to me being in your shoes, and my friends alongside me who have complained to me about the course."

This study guide is designed to teach you how to **"think like a coder"**, not just test your knowledge of the course up to this point. If you can complete the problems in the recommended time or less, you will do great on Midterm 2.

## 🧠 Strategic Problem Solving

### 1. Plan Before You Code
If you can't immediately see an obvious solution (which is expected for the Hard Problems), **do not just start writing code**.
* **Draw Flowcharts:** Visualize the logic.
* **Write Comments:** Type out your steps in plain English first.
* **Use Paper/Tablet:** Scribble down your ideas.
* **Why?** Problem-solving and innovation are the hard parts; the actual coding is often straightforward once you have a plan.

### 2. Read Carefully
It sounds simple—you were told this as a kid—but a lot of errors come from not fully understanding the question.
* Read the question.
* If you don't understand it, **read it again**
